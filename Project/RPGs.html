            <h3>Role Playing Games:</h3>

            <p>This is one of my favorite genres for many reasons, I love the fact that you can be whoever you want and decide which path to take your character which makes for fun interactions with in game characters and gives these games high replay ability since there are tons of outcomes. Role playing games allow players to assume the roles of a fictional character placed in a fictional setting. Players will take responsibility acting out these roles within the narrative through character development and decision making.</p>

                <h3>Fallout 4</h3>
                <p>I first played fallout back in 2008 when fallout 3 released. I had never heard of fallout before but the story for the game was really interesting and at that time I was really into RPG games. That game had immediately grabbed my attention and I fell in love with the post apocalyptic open world. So when fallout 4 released 7 years later I pre ordered it day one. Fallout 4 was another post apocalyptic open world game following the same premise as the previous game just in a different setting, Boston. You start off as the sole survivor of vault 111, after being awaken out of your cryogenic stasis to see your wife and your son kidnapped you get trapped again and re-frozen. You wake up later and venture out in search of your son. On your journey you run into unique characters, do side quests, help several factions and form relationships with your followers. Throughout the game as you level you can build the kind of character you want based on certain combat abilities or special perks. This game is a great starter into the fallout series with hundreds of hours of gameplay and DLC. Just recently the next fallout which will include multiplayer, was just announced and will be released this November (2018)!</p>

                <h3>Witcher 3</h3>
                <p>Another one of my favorite games that I still play to this day is The Witcher 3. This was the third and final installment in the witcher 3 series. Instead of creating a character you will play as Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. Although you can't create a character you can build him however you please and make decisions as you please. As Geralt you are in search of Ciri who is being hunted by the Wild Hunt which are wraiths who ride undead horses and are a sign of war. As you travel around the different regions in the world you find clues to Ciri's whereabouts and try to track her down. With the help of some old friends and old lovers you will do your best to defeat any monsters or people who get in your way. The witcher has a pretty deep crafting system and can be intimidating at first but should not deter any new players, the game offers very rich story and hundreds of hours of gameplay. The Witcher also offers DLC with new regions and up 50 more hours of gameplay. This is a fantastic game I think everyone should play it, new or veteran players to the role playing genre.</p>

                <h3>Divinity Original sin 2</h3>
                <p>In the beginning of the game you find yourself captured with a slave collar that limits your powers. But how did this happen? Well the Bishop, Alexander the innocent has declared that all sourcerers are criminals, those found to have source power are hunted, arrested and purged of their powers. You and your party members will travel through wastelands and cities, battlefields and temples to defeat Alexander. In this game you can either choose to play characters with their own origin stories or create your own character, you will then choose a class that can be very flexible depending on what kind of build you are going for. Now for this game there are a lot of mechanics, for example, if there is an earth element user and they cast a skill, it is possible oil will form in the area of effect. If then a fire caster or some fire is cast on that spot a fire will occur and will cause fire damage to anyone, friendlies or enemey in that spot. If a water user uses a water skill then the fire can be put out. This is just a small example of a very complex combat system. The combat isn't the only thing that is complex, there are so many possible character builds that it can be overwhelming for new players, but do not worry there are plenty of guides online to help. Along with character builds and combat, the crafting is also very deep, it will take some clever thinking to create armor, wepaons, tools, scrolls and much more but just like combat and builds there are plenty of guides online to help you. The combat is also turn based so this may turn a few people away. This game also allows co-op so that you may play with friends which can be a whole new experience itself. If you just want to play the game for the story you can choose the story difficulty which will scale back the combat so you may enjoy the game that way. I would only recommend this game to someone who is familiar with building characters and enjoys turn based combat. This game is also for anyone who is a fan of dungeons and dragons! </p>

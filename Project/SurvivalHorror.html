            <h3>Survival Horror: </h3>

            <p>Survival horror focuses on the players survival in a horror setting. most games in this use imagery and ambience to enhance the players experience of the thought of surviving in such a dreadful state. Players are meant to feel powerless in games that are of the survival horror genre and will find that resources throughout the game are limited and certain game mechanics may alter the way the player plays the game as well.</p>

            <p><i>I have not played a lot of survival horror games but the ones I have played were incredible. SO although it is a short list I can guarantee that one of these two games will convince you to look more into the genre.</i></p>

                <h3>Dying Light</h3>
                <p> To start us off, Dying Light. Dying light is a great game that uses a new mechanic that you don't see in many games, parkour. Throughout the game you use your parkour skills to scavenge, run, and fight your way through hordes of zombies. I found this game to be very intense especially in the night cylces where zombies were stronger and it was very dark. Usually in games you can see pretty well even at night but Dying Light takes an entirely new apporach by giving the player limited vision and the only safe place to go is the safe houses you might have liberated. This game has a great combination of survival and horror and it is why it made my list.</p>

                <h3>Resident Evil 7</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite games of all time is Resident evil, I love the resident evil franchise and have played the arcade versions as well as the console versions. When I heard that with the release of Resident Evil 7 they would be returning to their roots of a more stealth approach and survival tactics I knew the game would be intense. The most intense moments was when I would be in the basement in complete darkness looking for the next clue while fighting off monsters with little to no ammo in order to unlock the door to progress through the story. What made the game even more intense were the jump scares because they always happened at the right time and right when you let your guard down and sometimes these proved fatal. I would definitely recommend any of the Resident Evil games to any newcomers of the survival horror genre. </p>

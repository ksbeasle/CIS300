            <h3>Mobile: </h3>

            <p>Although this is technically not a genre, I decided to include since mobile gaming has been growing increasingly every year. Some of the games being developed are even on par with MMORPGs (Massivley Multiplayer online role-playing game) being able to support thousands of users from all over. There actually IS MMORPGs on the mobile phone unfortunately majority are only in the eastern market (japan, korea, etc). Below I will discuss some of the games that people can pick up whereever and whenever and pass the time but also keep you wanting to play more.</p>


            <div>
                <h3>Clash of Clans</h3>
                <p>One of the first games I played and actaully got addicted to was Clash of Clans. This is a base building type of game where you set up defenses and try to defend against enemy attacks when you are offline and not shielded. The primary point in the game is to attack other players to gain resources to upgrade your base and reach higher trophy counts. You can join a clan and participate in clan wars to gain even more resources to upgrade more buildings and defenses. I recently quit the game since I had been playing since launch and was burnt out but they recently added another base with new troops and new buildings for you to upgrade. This is a good starter mobile game since you can open it up and get a few attacks in and then upgrade your stuff which takes days sometimes weeks depending how high a level the building or defense is, so you won't have to be a daily player if you don't want to although there are people who play daily and pour money into the game but that is completely optional and will not keep you from progressing. </p>

                <h3>Clash Royale</h3>
                <p>This next game is actually developed by the same people who made Clash of Clans and has some of the troops in that game in this one as well as some exclusive troops unique to the game. I jumped into this around the time I stopped playing Clash of Clans. Clash Royale is a card collecting tower defense game where you strategically place your troops to counter your opponents attacks in live battles. The goal is to destroy your opponents kings' tower before they destroy yours. You can get stronger troops by collecting duplicate cards to upgrade that troop which will help you progress through the ranks and get better troops and legendary troops since certain legendary cards only unlock at certain ranks. This is also another good game you can jump in and play for a bit to kill time but will also keep you wanting to play more so there is replayability. Just like their previous game they implement a clan system where you can you clanmates can take on other clans to win legendary troop cards.</p>

                <h3>Fallout Shelter</h3>
                <p>For my #1 mobile game I have to give it to fallout shelter. I am a huge fan of the fallout series, (more about that <b><a href="RPGs.html">here</a></b>). This is definitely one of the best games I have played on a mobile device. This game is a simulation of a what it would be like to be the overseer of a vault and manage the resourceses and crafting through rooms that you build throughout your vault. You can send your vault dwellers out to complete quests for materials you need to craft weapons, armor or other things you want for your vault. There is no multiplayer for this game but that is fine since there is plenty to do with quests and defending against attacks on your vault. Your vault dwellers also can interact with eachother where you can pair them up to have children which will be the main way to build the population. This game is perfect if you don't want to worry about the online aspect of the other games mentioned above and just want to pace yourself to a relaxing vault simulation. </p>

            <h3>Racing</h3>

            <p>Racing games is played in either first or third person in which the player partakes in a racing competition with any type of land, water, air and even space! They are based on real world racing leagues or a fictional setting. There are many different racing games where some are more hardocre simulations and some are more arcade style racing.</p>

                <h3>Need For Speed: Payback</h3>
                <p>Need For Speed is a great racing franchise and was the first racing game I have ever played. The first game I played was Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2. I was pretty young at the time so I was playing pretty casually but I think that is what makes this franchise so great. You don't have to be a gear head or a car enthusiast to pick up this game and play. If you have an interest in cars and want to play a racing game and are looking for an intriguing story, Need For Speed Payback is a great game to start with. To give you an idea of the storyline without giving away too much; you will play multiple characters, Tyler Morgan, Mac, and Jess as you take on the house. When doing a job for a friend goes wrong, Tyler ends up being involved in a police chase and is about to be caught when he runs into a shady character, the gambler. So tyler has two options, be arrested, or work for him... Need For Speed Payback is a great game for anyone who is interested in racing games without the in depth modifications to improve the performance in your car. The modification system uses a card system where you can match cards of the same brand for boosts for your car, some people did not mind this system while others didn't like it at all. At the end of the day though, this is a solid racing game.</p>

                <h3>Forza Horizon 3</h3>
                <p>Forza Horizon is another great example of an arcade style racing game with a moderate level of in depth modifications for your cars, still giving you the freedom of really making whatever you want without the penalties. This installment in the franchise takes a different approach instead of starting at the bottom and proving yourself in races, YOU are the festival director. You are in charge of everything from which drivers to hire and which of them to fire, organize custome races and bucket list events around the map. Just like many other racing games you are also able to create custom paints and designs for your cars. This is another great game for some looking for an open world playground type of game where you are in control of how the races go.</p>

                <h3>Forza Motorsport</h3>
                <p>For number 1 I have chose Forza Motorsport which is more focused on the professional racing side. Some of the tracks included in the game are from real life tracks and locations from around the world. Although Forza Horizon and Forza Motorsport are similar they both take different approaches to racing simulation. The customization is similar you can still modify almost every part of the car but in Forza Motorsport there is a system called Homologate which places restrictions on cars, only cars that meet the requirements for a certain circuit can be used, so you won't be able to build a 1000+ horsepower beast for every race so a bit of strategy is needed to build the best car for whichever circuit you're are racing in. I would definitely recommend this game and this series to anyone who loves cars! </p>

            <h3>Sports:</h3>

            <p> The sports genre is just as the name suggest, sports games! Games that are categorized under the sports genre are mostly simulations of a sporting experience from the point of view of the athlete. Sports like hockey, baseball, basketball, football, soccer and many more are under the sports genre. </p>

                <h3>Madden NFL</h3>
                <p>The Game to start us off for the sports list is a favorite of mine, Madden NFL. Madden has been in production since the 80s and since the year 2000 has been in yearly releases. Personally I haven't played Madden in a couple years, not that I wasn't interested in it but becasue I had been preoccupied with other games, nonetheless this is the perfect game for a NFL fan or football lover with fun online game modes where you can create your own team with legendary players or play single player where you yourself can get drafted in the NFL and live out your dream of playing in the NFL.</p>

                <h3>NBA 2K</h3>
                <p>I have been a fan of the NBA since I was a kid and was even the first sport I ever played competitively. Although I don't play NBA 2k often this is definitely a game any fan of the NBA needs. There is so much you can do in the game. You can create your own player and follow your journey through the life of an NBA player while you try to make the draft, sign shoe deals and even make firends with other NBA stars. You can then take your created character to the Park game mode where you play other player created players in 3v3 or 2v2 games wher you can earn rep and coins to further upgrade your player or buy some gear. If thats not what you are looking for you can play GM mode where you take control of a team and manage everything from contracts to the starting lineup, you control everything! At the time of this review the next NBA 2k is about 2 weeks away so I will score the latest one, do not worry though NBA 2K follows a similar formula for all their games and the features mentioned above are in the next game as well. <strong>NBA 2K 18</strong> will be scored.</p>
